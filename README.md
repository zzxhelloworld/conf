# conf
Here are source codes involving some experiments on study of Composite Object Normal Form(CONF).
Firstly we implement our proposed lossless FD-preserved decomposition algorithm(alg1 at conf.CONF.java).
Then, we implement 3 algorithms to compare with as our paper introduced, that is, alg2(conf.CONF_Comp.java), alg3(conf.CONF_3NF.java) and alg4(conf.CONF_Basic.java).
