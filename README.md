# conf
Here are source codes involving some experiments on study of Composite Object Normal Form(CONF).
Firstly we implement our proposed lossless FD-preserved decomposition algorithm(alg1 at conf.CONF.java).
Then, we implement 3 algorithms to compare with as our paper introduced, that is, alg2(conf.CONF_Comp.java), alg3(conf.CONF_3NF.java) and alg4(conf.CONF_Basic.java).
# data set
>1. main experiment
For the main experiments,we compare 4 algorithms over 14 datasets. The datasets are available at https://hpi.de/naumann/projects/repeatability/data-profiling/fds.html
>2. TPC-H benchmark experiment
While for experiments over TPC-H benchmark, you can find data sets stored in databases with the link(https://relational.fit.cvut.cz/dataset/TPCH), which is 2G-sized data. You can follow instructions to export TPC-H databases into your own local databases.
